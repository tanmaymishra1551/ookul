## Overview

This project is designed for Full Stack Developers to demonstrate handling geospatial data. It allows users to:
- Upload and read KML files.
- Visualize KML elements on a map (using a tile provider such as OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, or Leaflet.js).
- Generate a summary table with counts of different element types.
- View detailed information showing each element type along with the total length for line-based features (e.g., Lines, LineStrings, MultiLineStrings).

## Features

- **KML File Upload**: Users can easily upload a KML file which is parsed and displayed.
- **Summary View**: A button to generate and display a table with counts of each KML element type.
- **Detailed View**: A button to reveal element types with calculated total lengths for line-related elements.
- **Map Integration**: Visual representation of KML elements on a map tile for enhanced spatial context.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Mapping**: Map providers OpenStreetMap
- **KML Parsing**: JavaScript libraries for parsing KML files
